/*The provided code defines functions for managing and interacting with a Card structure in a poker game. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:

1. card_init Function*/
void card_init(Card * aCardPtr, int suit, int rank){
  aCardPtr->suit = suit;
  aCardPtr->rank = rank;
}
/*Purpose: Initializes a Card object by setting its suit and rank values.
Parameters:
aCardPtr: A pointer to the Card structure to be initialized.
suit: The suit of the card (e.g., Spades, Hearts, etc.).
rank: The rank of the card (e.g., 2, 3, ..., 10, J, Q, K, A).
Usage: This function is called to assign values to a card after it is created.
2. card_toString Function*/
int card_toString(Card * aCardPtr){
  if (aCardPtr == NULL) {
    return -1; // Error: NULL pointer
  }
  switch (aCardPtr->rank) {
    case 11: putchar('J'); break;
    case 12: putchar('Q'); break;
    case 13: putchar('K'); break;
    case 14: putchar('A'); break;
    default: printf("%d", aCardPtr->rank); break;
  }
  putchar(' ');
  switch (aCardPtr->suit) {
    case 1: printf("of Spades"); break;
    case 2: printf("of Hearts"); break;
    case 3: printf("of Diamonds"); break;
    case 4: printf("of Clubs"); break;
    default: printf("of %d", aCardPtr->suit); break;
  }
  putchar('\n');
  return 0; // Success
}

/*Purpose: Prints the card's rank and suit in a human-readable format (e.g., "A of Spades").
Parameters:
aCardPtr: A pointer to the Card structure to be printed.
Implementation:
Checks if the card pointer is NULL. If so, it returns -1 to indicate an error.
Uses a switch statement to print the rank:
Ranks 11, 12, 13, and 14 are mapped to "J", "Q", "K", and "A", respectively.
Other ranks are printed as integers.
Prints the suit using another switch statement:
Suit values 1, 2, 3, and 4 are mapped to "Spades", "Hearts", "Diamonds", and "Clubs".
If the suit is invalid, it prints the numeric value of the suit.
Ends with a newline (putchar('\n')) and returns 0 on success.
3. card_compare Function*/
int card_compare(const void *a, const void *b){
  const Card *cardA = *(const Card **)a;
  const Card *cardB = *(const Card **)b;
  return cardA->rank - cardB->rank;
}
/*Purpose: Compares two cards based on their rank. This function is typically used with sorting algorithms like qsort.
Parameters:
a and b: Pointers to pointers of Card objects.
Implementation:
Dereferences the pointers to access the rank of each card.
Returns the difference between the ranks:
A negative value if a's rank is less than b's rank.
Zero if the ranks are equal.
A positive value if a's rank is greater than b's rank.
4. card_destroy Function*/
void card_destroy(Card * aCardPtr){
  free(aCardPtr);
}
/*Purpose: Frees the memory allocated for a Card object.
Parameters:
aCardPtr: A pointer to the Card structure to be destroyed.
Usage: This function should be called when a card is no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.
General Observations
Memory Management:

The card_destroy function ensures proper cleanup of dynamically allocated Card objects.
However, the code does not include the allocation of Card objects, which is likely handled elsewhere in the program.
Error Handling:

The card_toString function checks for NULL pointers, which is good practice.
Other functions (e.g., card_compare) assume valid input and do not perform error checks.
Code Readability:

The use of switch statements for rank and suit mapping makes the code easy to read and extend.
Adding comments to explain the purpose of each function would improve clarity.
Potential Improvements:

In card_toString, invalid suit values are printed as integers. It might be better to print an error message instead.
The card_compare function could include a NULL check for robustness.
Example Usage*/
Hereâ€™s how these functions might be used in a program:
Card *card = (Card *)malloc(sizeof(Card));
card_init(card, 1, 14); // Initialize card as "A of Spades"
card_toString(card);    // Prints: "A of Spades"
card_destroy(card);     // Frees the allocated memory

```
