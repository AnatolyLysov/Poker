**Bash commands** are instructions you type into a terminal (command line) on Linux, macOS, 
or other Unix-like systems. Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is the most common shell used 
for interacting with your system.

Here are some basics:

### File and Directory Commands
- `ls` — List files and directories.
- `cd <directory>` — Change directory.
- `pwd` — Print current working directory.
- `mkdir <directory>` — Make a new directory.
- `rm <file>` — Remove a file.
- `rm -r <directory>` — Remove a directory and its contents.
- `cp <source> <destination>` — Copy files or directories.
- `mv <source> <destination>` — Move or rename files or directories.

### Viewing and Editing Files
- `cat <file>` — Print file contents.
- `less <file>` — View file contents page by page.
- `nano <file>` — Edit a file in the terminal.
- `head <file>` — Show the first lines of a file.
- `tail <file>` — Show the last lines of a file.

### System and Process Commands
- `ps` — Show running processes.
- `top` — Monitor system processes.
- `kill <pid>` — Stop a process by its process ID.

### Package and Project Management
- `make` — Run commands from a Makefile (like `make run`, `make clean`).
- `gcc` — Compile C programs.
- `bundle install` — Install Ruby project dependencies.
- `gem install <gemname>` — Install a Ruby gem.

### Other Useful Commands
- `echo <text>` — Print text to the terminal.
- `history` — Show command history.
- `man <command>` — Show the manual for a command.

You can combine commands, use options (like `ls -l`), and use `Tab` for autocompletion. 
Bash is very powerful for automating tasks and managing your development environment.
