Below is a step-by-step guide on how to install the Remote - WSL extension using your WSL Ubuntu environment.

### 1. Ensure VS Code Is Installed on Windows  
The Remote - WSL extension is installed in your main VS Code installation on Windows. Make sure you have the latest version of Visual Studio Code installed.

### 2. Open VS Code from WSL  
- Open your Ubuntu terminal in WSL.  
- Navigate to any directory or directly launch VS Code by typing:

  code .

This command opens VS Code in the context of your current WSL directory.

### 3. Access the Extensions View  
- In VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the left side (or press Ctrl+Shift+X).  

### 4. Search for the Remote - WSL Extension  
- In the Extensions search bar, type “Remote - WSL”.  
- You should see the official extension by Microsoft (ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl).

### 5. Install the Extension  
- Click the **Install** button next to the Remote - WSL extension.

Visual Studio Code will automatically download and install the extension. You might see additional prompts to install companion components 
specific to the WSL environment. Accept any prompts to complete the setup.

### 6. Verify Installation  
After installation, the extension should be activated in your VS Code running in the context of WSL. You can check this by:
- Looking for a green indicator in the bottom-left corner showing that VS Code is connected to your WSL window.
- Accessing the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and typing “Remote-WSL” to see available commands.

### 7. Optional: Install via Command Line  
If you prefer using the command line, while connected to your WSL instance, exit VS Code and run:

  code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl

This command installs the extension directly.

Once you’ve completed these steps, you’re ready to work with VS Code seamlessly in your WSL Ubuntu environment using the Remote - WSL extension. Enjoy coding!
